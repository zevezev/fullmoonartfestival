- WORKING ON add event info for Novemnber 27

11/18 agenda: 

The moon symbol should have the moon filled ness of the current moon

PIXEL font

STARFIELD (p5):
Steps:
- just show circles, when clicked open dialog
- show circles but in p5 canvas https://github.com/P5-wrapper/react
- randomly place circles in canvas
-  stars instead of circles
- star twinkle
- star size increase when hover
- any way to incorporate this into main site instead of just in the page?
- maybe moon menu becomes the canvas. then we can have it on every page.


- each message creates a star that enters the field
- click the star to read the message
- stars should not spawn on top of each others
- stars should have procedural generation to look like the kinds of stars I draw
- stars should take colors from some of my colors
- generate stars for each message, each with an onclick to show the message
